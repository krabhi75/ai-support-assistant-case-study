# Assumptions & Hypotheses

## Key Assumptions
1. A significant portion of L1 tickets can be resolved using documentation
2. Users trust AI answers when sources are visible
3. Incorrect answers cause more harm than delayed answers

## Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Metric | Validation Method |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| AI can deflect L1 tickets | Deflection rate | A/B testing |
| Users trust AI responses | CSAT | Post-response survey |
| Guardrails reduce failures | Hallucination rate | Output audits |

## Falsification Criteria
- CSAT drops below baseline
- Hallucination rate exceeds threshold
- Increased escalations due to AI errors
