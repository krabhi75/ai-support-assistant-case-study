# Problem Framing

## Problem Statement
SaaS customer support teams face a high volume of repetitive Level-1 queries related
to onboarding, pricing, and basic feature usage. These queries consume agent time,
increase operational cost, and delay resolution for complex issues.

## Who Is Affected
- Primary: End users seeking quick answers
- Secondary: Support agents handling escalations
- Tertiary: Product teams receiving noisy feedback

## Why This Matters Now
- SaaS scale increases support cost non-linearly
- Users expect instant, self-serve answers
- LLMs enable new support experiences but introduce risk

## Non-Goals
- Replacing human support agents
- Handling account-specific or sensitive actions
- Providing legal or financial advice
