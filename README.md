## 📘 How to Read This Case Study (Chronological Flow)

This project is structured to reflect **how an AI product is actually built in practice** —
from problem discovery to AI evaluation and rollout decisions.

If you are reviewing this case study for the first time, I recommend reading the documents
in the following order:

### 1️⃣ Problem Discovery & Context
Start here to understand *what problem is being solved and why*.

- [`problem-framing.md`](./docs/problem-framing.md)  
- [`users-context.md`](./docs/users-context.md)  

---

### 2️⃣ Assumptions & Hypotheses
Key assumptions and how they were validated or falsified.

- [`assumptions-hypotheses.md`](./docs/assumptions-hypotheses.md)

---

### 3️⃣ Solution & AI System Decisions
How the solution was designed and why specific AI approaches were chosen.

- [`ai-decisions-tradeoffs.md`](./docs/ai-decisions-tradeoffs.md)

---

### 4️⃣ Metrics & Success Definition
How success is defined across product, business, and AI quality dimensions.

- [`metrics-framework.md`](./docs/metrics-framework.md)

---

### 5️⃣ AI Evaluation & Prompt Iteration
How AI quality is measured, evaluated, and improved before production rollout.

- [`ai-evaluation-framework.md`](./docs/ai-evaluation-framework.md)  
- [`prompt-iterations-evaluation.md`](./docs/prompt-iterations-evaluation.md)

---

### 6️⃣ Experimentation & Rollout
How the solution is tested, monitored, and safely rolled out.

- [`experimentation-plan.md`](./docs/experimentation-plan.md)  
- [`rollout-monitoring.md`](./docs/rollout-monitoring.md)

---

### 7️⃣ Risks, Guardrails & Failure Analysis
Known failure modes, safety considerations, and mitigation strategies.

- [`risks-guardrails.md`](./docs/risks-guardrails.md)  
- [`rca-failure-analysis.md`](./docs/rca-failure-analysis.md)

---

### 8️⃣ Learnings & Next Steps
What worked, what didn’t, and how the product will evolve.

- [`learnings-next-steps.md`](./docs/learnings-next-steps.md)
